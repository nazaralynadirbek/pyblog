                        Welcome to Google's Python Class -- this is a free class for people with a little bit of programming experience who want to learn Python.
                        The class includes written materials, lecture videos, and lots of code exercises to practice Python coding.
                        These materials are used within Google to introduce Python to people who have just a little programming experience.
                        The first exercises work on basic Python concepts like strings and lists, building up to the later exercises which are full programs dealing with text files, processes, and http connections.
                        The class is geared for people who have a little bit of programming experience in some language, enough to know what a "variable" or "if statement" is.
                        Beyond that, you do not need to be an expert programmer to use this material.
